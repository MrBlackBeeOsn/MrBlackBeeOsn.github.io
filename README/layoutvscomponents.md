Here is a more detailed comparison table:

Layout (Bố cục)

- Role: The overall "framework," defining how the main components are arranged on the page.
- Purpose: Ensures that the components are positioned correctly, creating a harmonious and user-friendly page structure.
- Characteristics: Often unique on a page or a set of pages with a shared structure (e.g., all product pages).
- Composition: Contains components and other HTML elements to create the framework.
- Examples: The overall structure of a website, including Header, Footer, Sidebar, and Main Content.

Component (Thành phần)

- Role: An independent, reusable UI element that performs a specific function.
- Purpose: Encapsulates the logic and interface for a small element, such as a button, product card, or menu.
- Characteristics: Can be nested in many different layouts and reused many times.
- Composition: Often includes a few separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tags.
- Examples: Buttons, search bars, user cards, navigation bars.

Relationship Between Components and Layouts

- Layouts contain Components: A large layout will include many smaller components. For example, a website with a basic layout will have a Header (layout), which may contain components like <Logo>, <Searchbar>, and <Navigation>.

- Components can have their own layout: A complex component can also have its own internal layout. For example, a <ProductCard> component may have a simple layout to arrange the image, product name, and price. 

In summary, you can visualize:

- Components as bricks.
- Layouts as the blueprint of the house.
