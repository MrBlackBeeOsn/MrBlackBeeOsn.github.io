This command sets up a modern React project with no build configuration."},{id:2,question:"In React, which hook is used to manage state in a functional component?",options:["useEffect","useContext","useReducer","useState"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"The useState hook is the primary way to add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it."},{id:3,question:"What will happen when the following code runs? setCount(count + 1); setCount(count + 1);",options:["count increases by 1.","count increases by 2.","It causes an error.","count does not change."],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"React batches state updates, and since count is stale in both calls, they both set the same value. To update twice, use a function: setCount(prev => prev + 1)."},{id:4,question:"Which method is invoked right after a component is mounted (inserted into the DOM)?",options:["componentWillMount","componentDidUpdate","componentDidMount","render"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"In class components, componentDidMount is called after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. In functional components, the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array mimics this."},{id:5,question:"How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component?",options:["Using state","Using refs","Using props","Using context"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Props are the primary mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React."},{id:6,question:"What is the purpose of the key prop when rendering a list of elements?",options:["To improve component styling.","To identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.","To make items clickable.","To store additional data about the element."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Keys help React track elements in a list, optimizing re-rendering by identifying changes efficiently."},{id:7,question:"Which of the following is true about React fragments?",options:["They create an extra DOM element.","They are used to group multiple elements without adding a wrapper node.","They improve performance by reducing CSS overhead.","They can only contain two elements."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Fragments (<>...</>) let you group children without adding extra DOM nodes, keeping the HTML clean."},{id:8,question:"What does the useEffect hook do?",options:["It performs side effects in functional components.","It optimizes component rendering.","It manages component state.","It creates reusable logic."],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"useEffect handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in functional components."},{id:9,question:"How can you prevent a component from re-rendering unnecessarily?",options:["Using React.forwardRef","Using React.memo","Using React.fragment","Using React.createRef"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the result, preventing re-renders if props haven’t changed."},{id:10,question:"In React, what is Context used for?",options:["To replace Redux in all applications.","To pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.","To manage component state locally.","To handle routing between pages."],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Context provides a way to share values (like themes, authentication) between components without passing props manually at every level."}];return e.jsx("main",{className:"image image2",children:e.jsxs("article",{children:[e.jsx("h4",{children:e.jsx(o,{smooth:!0,to:"/programming#react-js-basic-practice",children:e.jsx("mark",{className:"highlight-tertiary-padding-4-8",children:"React"})})}),e.jsxs("header",{className:"quiz-header",children:[e.jsx("h1",{className:"margin-y-50 text-center",children:"React JS Practice"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"subtitle text-center",children:"Test your knowledge of fundamental programming concepts"})]}),e.jsx(n,{questions:t}),e.jsx("div",{className:"viewcounter",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"post-date no-margin",children:e.jsx("span",{children:"December 04, 2025 · by DPSK ·"})})})]})})}export{r as default};
