Constants must be initialized when declared, and their value cannot be reassigned later."},{id:2,question:"What will be the output of the following code? console.log(typeof null);",options:['"null"','"undefined"','"object"','"number"'],correctAnswer:2,explanation:`In JavaScript, the typeof operator returns "object" for null. This is a historical quirk in the language's design from its earliest implementation and remains for backward compatibility.`},{id:3,question:"Which method is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array and return the new length of the array?",options:["shift()","unshift()","push()","pop()"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the array's new length."},{id:4,question:"Which of the following is not a primitive data type in JavaScript?",options:["string","boolean","object","bigint"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"object is a non-primitive (reference) data type used for complex structures. Primitive data types include string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null."},{id:5,question:"In JavaScript, which comparison operator checks for both value and type equality (strict equality)?",options:["==","!=","===","="],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"The strict equality operator (===) checks if the operands are equal and of the same type, without performing type coercion."},{id:6,question:'What is the purpose of the "use strict" directive in JavaScript?',options:["To enable asynchronous operations.","To indicate that the code should be compiled before execution.","To enforce stricter parsing and error handling in the code.","To define a new scope for variables."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:'The "use strict" directive enables strict mode, which helps write "secure" JavaScript by eliminating silent errors (like using undeclared variables) and introducing better error handling.'},{id:7,question:'How do you write an IF statement in JavaScript to execute code if "i" is not equal to 5?',options:["if (i <> 5)","if (i != 5)","if i not equal 5","if (i =! 5)"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:'The != operator is the standard JavaScript operator for "not equal to" (loose inequality). For strict inequality (checking value and type), you would use !==.'},{id:8,question:"Which JavaScript function is used to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object?",options:["JSON.stringify()","JSON.parse()","JSON.toObject()","Object.toJSON()"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"JSON.parse() is used to parse a JSON string and construct the JavaScript value or object described by the string. JSON.stringify() converts an object to a JSON string."},{id:9,question:"What keyword is used to define a function that handles asynchronous operations and implicitly returns a Promise?",options:["sync","await","callback","async"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"The async keyword is used before a function declaration to make it an asynchronous function, which implicitly returns a Promise."},{id:10,question:"Which event is triggered when a user releases a key on the keyboard?",options:["onkeypress","onkeydown","onkeyup","onrelease"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"The onkeyup event occurs when the user releases a key. onkeydown occurs when a key is pressed down."}];return e.jsx("main",{className:"image image2",children:e.jsxs("article",{children:[e.jsx("h4",{children:e.jsx(i,{smooth:!0,to:"/programming#js-basic-practice",children:e.jsx("mark",{className:"highlight-tertiary-padding-4-8",children:"JavaScript"})})}),e.jsxs("header",{className:"quiz-header",children:[e.jsx("h1",{className:"margin-y-50 text-center",children:"JavaScript Quiz"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"subtitle text-center",children:"Test your knowledge of fundamental JavaScript concepts"})]}),e.jsx(n,{questions:t}),e.jsx("div",{className:"viewcounter",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"post-date no-margin",children:e.jsx("span",{children:"December 15, 2025 · by 💎Gem ·"})})})]})})}export{s as default};
