    <h2 class="last-first-of-type">What is a spreadsheet?</h2>
    
    <p>A <b>spreadsheet</b> is a digital tool for organizing and working with information. It's like a giant table with squares you can fill in. Here's a breakdown:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Squares = Cells:</b> Each little box in the <b>spreadsheet</b> is called a cell. You can put text, numbers, or even dates in these cells.</li>

        <li><b>Rows & Columns:</b> The <b>spreadsheet</b> has rows (going across) and columns (going down). This helps you find things easily, like on a checkerboard. Each cell is named by its row number and column letter (like A1 or C4).</li>

        <li><b>Worksheets:</b> Think of a <b>spreadsheet</b> like a notebook with multiple pages. Each page is called a worksheet, and you can have different worksheets to organize different things.</li>

        <li><b>Number Crunching: Spreadsheets</b> are great for calculations! You can write special instructions called formulas to automatically add, subtract, multiply, or do other math with the numbers in your cells.</li>

        <li><b>More Than Numbers: Spreadsheets</b> aren't just for numbers! You can also use them to make lists, track things like schedules or allowances, or even create charts to see your data visually.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="last-of-type"><b>Spreadsheets</b> are like digital organizers that can help you with all sorts of tasks!</p>

    <h3 class="last-first-of-type">🌾 Please explain to me like I'm 5!</h3>
    
    <p>A <b>spreadsheet</b> is like a giant checklist at school, but way cooler! Remember how your teacher has those big sheets with squares to mark stuff off? A <b>spreadsheet</b> is like that, but on a computer.</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><b>Boxes = Cells:</b> Each square on the checklist is like a box in a <b>spreadsheet</b>, called a cell. You can write things in these cells, like your toys, your favorite foods, or even how many stickers you have!</li>

        <li><b>Lines Make it Easy:</b> The checklist has lines going across and down, right? Those are like rows and columns in a <b>spreadsheet</b>. They help you find your stuff quickly, just like finding your name on the attendance sheet.</li>

        <li><b>Sheets for Different Things:</b> Maybe you have different checklists for schoolwork and chores. A <b>spreadsheet</b> can have different pages too, called worksheets. You can use one for your toys and another for your yummy snacks!</li>

        <li><b>Magic Math:</b> Sometimes you need to add stickers on your checklist. In a <b>spreadsheet</b>, you can use special words called formulas to do math for you, like adding all your toys together!</li>

        <li><b>Fun Colors and Pictures:</b> Your teacher might use colored pens on the checklist. <b>Spreadsheets</b> let you change the colors and even add little pictures to your cells, making it extra fun!</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="last-of-type"><b>Spreadsheets</b> are like fancy checklists that help you keep track of all your stuff and even do cool tricks with numbers. It's like having a super-powered organizer at your fingertips!</p>
