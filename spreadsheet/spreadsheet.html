    <h2 class="last-first-of-type">What is a spreadsheet?</h2>
    
    <p>A <strong>spreadsheet</strong> is a digital tool for organizing and working with information. It's like a giant table with squares you can fill in. Here's a breakdown:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Squares</strong> = <strong>Cells</strong>: Each little box in the <strong>spreadsheet</strong> is called a cell. You can put text, numbers, or even dates in these cells.</li>

        <li><strong>Rows</strong> & <strong>Columns</strong>: The <strong>spreadsheet</strong> has rows (going across) and columns (going down). This helps you find things easily, like on a checkerboard. Each cell is named by its row number and column letter (like A1 or C4).</li>

        <li><strong>Worksheets</strong>: Think of a <strong>spreadsheet</strong> like a notebook with multiple pages. Each page is called a worksheet, and you can have different worksheets to organize different things.</li>

        <li><strong>Number Crunching</strong>: <strong>Spreadsheets</strong> are great for calculations! You can write special instructions called formulas to automatically add, subtract, multiply, or do other math with the numbers in your cells.</li>

        <li><strong>More Than Numbers</strong>: <strong>Spreadsheets</strong> aren't just for numbers! You can also use them to make lists, track things like schedules or allowances, or even create charts to see your data visually.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="last-of-type"><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> are like digital organizers that can help you with all sorts of tasks!</p>

    <p>A <strong>spreadsheet</strong> is like a giant checklist at school, but way cooler! Remember how your teacher has those big sheets with squares to mark stuff off? A <strong>spreadsheet</strong> is like that, but on a computer.</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Boxes</strong> = <strong>Cells</strong>: Each square on the checklist is like a box in a <strong>spreadsheet</strong>, called a cell. You can write things in these cells, like your toys, your favorite foods, or even how many stickers you have!</li>

        <li><strong>Lines Make it Easy</strong>: The checklist has lines going across and down, right? Those are like rows and columns in a <strong>spreadsheet</strong>. They help you find your stuff quickly, just like finding your name on the attendance sheet.</li>

        <li><strong>Sheets for Different Things</strong>: Maybe you have different checklists for schoolwork and chores. A <strong>spreadsheet</strong> can have different pages too, called worksheets. You can use one for your toys and another for your yummy snacks!</li>

        <li><strong>Magic Math</strong>: Sometimes you need to add stickers on your checklist. In a <strong>spreadsheet</strong>, you can use special words called formulas to do math for you, like adding all your toys together!</li>

        <li><strong>Fun Colors and Pictures</strong>: Your teacher might use colored pens on the checklist. <strong>Spreadsheets</strong> let you change the colors and even add little pictures to your cells, making it extra fun!</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="last-of-type"><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> are like fancy checklists that help you keep track of all your stuff and even do cool tricks with numbers. It's like having a super-powered organizer at your fingertips!</p>
