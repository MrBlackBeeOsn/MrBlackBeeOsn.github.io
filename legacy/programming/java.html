    <h2 class="margin-y-50 text-center" id="programming-terms">What is Java?</h2>

    <!-- This is the content of Programming Term. -->
    
    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's a general-purpose language that's concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to be portable, allowing developers to "write once, run anywhere."</p>
    
    <p class="margin-top-20">Core Principles and Features</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Platform Independence</strong>: A key feature of <strong>Java</strong> is its ability to run on any device with a <strong>Java</strong> Virtual Machine (JVM). The <strong>Java</strong> code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which the JVM can execute regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.</li>

        <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong>: <strong>Java</strong>'s core is built around objects. Everything in <strong>Java</strong> is an object, which helps in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.</li>

        <li><strong>Automatic Memory Management</strong>: The JVM includes a garbage collector that automatically manages memory, freeing up memory from objects that are no longer in use. This simplifies development and helps prevent memory-related errors.</li>

        <li><strong>Robustness and Security</strong>: <strong>Java</strong> has a strong emphasis on security. Its strict compile-time checks and the JVM's sandboxing environment protect systems from malicious code. It's designed to be reliable, with features that help manage errors and prevent crashes.</li>

        <li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: <strong>Java</strong> has built-in support for multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This is essential for building high-performance applications.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Common Use Cases</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Enterprise Applications</strong>: <strong>Java</strong> is widely used for building large-scale, mission-critical applications for businesses and financial institutions.</li>

        <li><strong>Android App Development</strong>: It's the primary language for native Android development.</li>

        <li><strong>Web Applications</strong>: Frameworks like Spring and Jakarta EE are used to build dynamic web services and applications.</li>

        <li><strong>Big Data</strong>: Technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, which are built with <strong>Java</strong>, are used for processing and analyzing large datasets.</li>

        <li><strong>Scientific and Research Applications</strong>: Its stability and numerical capabilities make it a good choice for scientific software.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Because of its stability, scalability, and large ecosystem, <strong>Java</strong> remains a dominant language in software development, particularly for large, complex systems where reliability is paramount.</p>

    <h3 class="margin-bottom-50 text-center">🌾 Think simply!</h3>

    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a special kind of magic that helps you build amazing things for the computer. It's like having a big box of super cool building blocks.</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li>You can use these blocks to build apps for your phone, so you can play games or talk to friends.</li>

        <li>You can also use them to make websites that people can visit on their computers.</li>

        <li>The best part is that once you build something with <strong>Java</strong>, it can work on almost any computer or phone, no matter what kind it is!</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">So, <strong>Java</strong> is a secret language that helps you build things for computers that can be shared with everyone!</p>
