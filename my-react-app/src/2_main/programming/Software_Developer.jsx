    <h2 className="margin-y-50 text-center">What is a Software Developer?</h2>

    {/* This is the content of Programming Term. */}

    <p>A <strong>software developer</strong> is a professional who creates, tests, and maintains software applications and systems. They are responsible for the entire software development lifecycle, from initial concept to deployment and ongoing support. While the terms "<strong>software developer</strong>," "programmer," and "software engineer" are often used interchangeably, a developer typically has a broader role that includes design, collaboration, and project management in addition to writing code.</p>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Core Responsibilities</p>
    
      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Design and Planning</strong>: Before writing code, a developer plans the software's structure and functionality. This involves creating blueprints, flowcharts, and user stories to ensure the final product meets the client's or user's needs.</li>

        <li><strong>Coding and Implementation</strong>: This is the most common task. Developers write source code using various programming languages (like Python, Java, or JavaScript) to build the application. This code dictates how the software will perform specific tasks.</li>

        <li><strong>Testing and Quality Assurance</strong>: Developers test their code to find and fix errors, or "bugs." They ensure the software runs smoothly, is secure, and performs as expected under different conditions. This includes writing automated tests and performing manual checks.</li>

        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Most software development is a team effort. Developers work with project managers, designers, and other developers to build features and solve problems. They often use version control systems like Git to manage changes to the code base.</li>

        <li><strong>Maintenance and Updates</strong>: After a product is released, developers continue to support it. They fix new bugs, add features, and update the software to keep it compatible with new technologies and operating systems.</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Specializations</p>

    <p><strong>Software developers</strong> often specialize in a specific area:</p>

    <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center"><a href="front-end-developer.html">Front-End Developer</a></h4>
          
    <p>Focuses on the user-facing part of an application, including the design and interactivity of a website. They work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create what users see and interact with.</p>

    <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center"><a href="back-end-developer.html">Back-End Developer</a></h4>
      
    <p>Deals with the server-side of an application, including databases, servers, and business logic. They ensure the core functionality of a website, such as user authentication or data storage, works correctly.</p>

    <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center"><a href="full-stack-developer.html">Full-Stack Developer</a></h4>
      
    <p>Has knowledge of both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to work on all parts of a software application.</p>

    <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center"><a href="mobile-developer.html">Mobile Developer</a></h4>
          
    <p>Specializes in creating applications for mobile platforms like iOS and Android.</p>

    <p className="margin-top-20">In short, a <strong>software developer</strong> is a skilled professional who combines logical problem-solving with technical expertise to build the digital tools and applications that power our modern world.</p>

    <h3 className="margin-bottom-50 text-center">ðŸŒ¾ Think simply!</h3>
    
    <p>A <strong>software developer</strong> is a person who builds and fixes computer programs. They're like builders, but instead of using wood and nails, they use a special secret language called code.</p>
    
      <ul className="list-square">

        <li>They make apps and games for your phone and computer.</li>

        <li>They fix things when a program isn't working right.</li>

        <li>They make sure the programs are safe to use.</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">So, whenever you play a game on a tablet or watch a cartoon on a computer, a <strong>software developer</strong> helped make it happen!</p>
