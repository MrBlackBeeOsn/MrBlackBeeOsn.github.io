    <!-- This is the content of Programming Term. -->

    <p><strong>PHP</strong>, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. It is a powerful tool for building dynamic websites, web applications, and content management systems.</p>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Key Characteristics</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Server-Side Scripting</strong>: This is the most important characteristic of <strong>PHP</strong>. Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, <strong>PHP</strong> code is executed on the web server, not the user's browser. The server processes the <strong>PHP</strong> script and then sends the resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the user's browser.</li>

        <li><strong>Embedded in HTML</strong>: <strong>PHP</strong> is designed to be easily embedded directly into HTML code. This allows developers to combine server-side logic with the front-end user interface.</li>

        <li><strong>Open Source and Free</strong>: <strong>PHP</strong> is open-source, which means it is free to use, modify, and distribute. This has led to a large and active community, as well as a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries.</li>

        <li><strong>Database Integration</strong>: <strong>PHP</strong> has excellent built-in support for interacting with a wide variety of databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. This is essential for dynamic websites that need to store and retrieve information.</li>

        <li><strong>Multi-Platform</strong>: <strong>PHP</strong> can run on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It also works with most popular web servers like Apache and Nginx.</li>

        <li><strong>Versatility</strong>: While its primary use is web development, <strong>PHP</strong> can also be used for command-line scripting to automate tasks and even to create desktop applications.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Common Use Cases</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Dynamic Websites</strong>: <strong>PHP</strong> is used to create web pages that change based on user input, database content, or other variables.</li>

        <li><strong>Content Management Systems</strong> (<strong>CMS</strong>): Many of the world's most popular CMS platforms, such as WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, are built with <strong>PHP</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>E-commerce Applications</strong>: It's used to build online stores, handling product catalogs, shopping carts, and payment processing.</li>

        <li><strong>Social Media Platforms</strong>: <strong>PHP</strong> was a core language for building early versions of platforms like Facebook.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">In summary, <strong>PHP</strong> is a robust and widely used language for building the back-end of websites. Its ease of use and powerful features have made it a go-to choice for developers for many years.</p>

    <p><strong>PHP</strong> is a secret language that helps websites remember things and make them fun to use. It's like a magic helper that lives on the computer's brain (called a server).</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>How it helps</strong>: When you type your name into a website, <strong>PHP</strong> remembers your name and can show it to you on the next page. It also helps websites show you your favorite videos or toys.</li>

        <li><strong>Why it's a secret</strong>: You can't see <strong>PHP</strong>'s work. It does all the hard thinking for the website before it even shows up on your screen.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">So, when a website seems smart and remembers what you like, it's because <strong>PHP</strong> is working hard behind the scenes!</p>
