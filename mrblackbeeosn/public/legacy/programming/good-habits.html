    <h2 class="margin-y-50 text-center" id="programming-terms">What are good habits?</h1>

    <!-- This is the content of Programming Term. -->

    <p>Here are some <strong>good habits</strong> to develop as a programmer:</p>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Code Readability and Maintainability:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Write clear and concise variable and function names</strong>: Names should accurately reflect what the variable or function does. Avoid abbreviations or overly generic names.</li>

        <li><strong>Add comments to explain complex logic</strong>: Comments help others (and future you!) understand the purpose of specific code sections.</li>

        <li><strong>Use consistent formatting and indentation</strong>: Proper formatting improves readability and makes the code structure visually clear.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Code Correctness and Efficiency:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Test your code thoroughly</strong>: Write test cases to verify the code produces the expected output for various inputs. Utilize debugging tools to identify and fix errors.</li>

        <li><strong>Break down complex problems into smaller steps</strong>: This makes the code easier to write, understand, test, and potentially reuse.</li>

        <li><strong>Think about efficiency</strong>: While not always critical, consider how to optimize your code for performance if necessary. This might involve using appropriate data structures or algorithms.</li>

      </ul>
    
    <p class="margin-top-20">Learning and Growth:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Practice regularly</strong>: The more you code, the better you become at it. Set aside time to work on personal projects or coding exercises.</li>

        <li><strong>Stay updated with new developments</strong>: Programming languages and technologies evolve. Make an effort to learn about new features, libraries, and best practices.</li>

        <li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help</strong>: No programmer knows everything. Utilize online communities, forums, or seek help from experienced programmers when stuck.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Version Control and Collaboration:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Use version control</strong>: Version control systems like Git track changes to your code over time. This allows you to revert to previous versions if necessary and collaborate effectively with other programmers.</li>

        <li><strong>Write code that can be reused</strong>: Consider creating well-documented functions or modules that can be used in other parts of your code or even future projects.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Personal Well-being:</p>
    
      <ul class="list-square">

        <li><strong>Take breaks</strong>: Staring at code for extended periods can hinder creativity and make it difficult to spot errors. Take short breaks to refresh your mind.</li>

        <li><strong>Maintain a healthy work-life balance</strong>: Coding can be absorbing, but it's important to disconnect and recharge outside of coding time.</li>

      </ul>

    <p class="margin-top-20">Remember, these are general guidelines, and the specific habits you prioritize might depend on your programming goals and preferences. However, focusing on these aspects will help you write cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code as you progress in your programming journey.</p>

    <h3 class="margin-bottom-50 text-center">üåæ Think simply!</h3>
    
    <p>Programmers are like builders who create awesome things with code, but just like any builder, they need <strong>good habits</strong> to build the best things possible! Here are some ways programmers can be super builders:</p>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Clear Labels for Your Tools (Write clean and concise code):</h4>
    
    <p>Imagine a toolbox with everything mixed together. It's hard to find what you need! Programmers use clear names for things in their code, like "redShirt" or "happySound," so they (and others) can easily understand what each part does.</p>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Double Checking Your Work (Testing Code):</h4>
    
    <p>Before a builder lets someone live in a house, they check everything works properly. Programmers do this too! They write tests to see if their code does what it's supposed to, like making sure a button press plays a sound.</p>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Building One Block at a Time (Breaking problems down):</h4>
    
    <p>Building a whole house at once can be overwhelming! Builders break it down into smaller tasks. Programmers do this too! They take big problems and break them into smaller, easier-to-solve steps, making coding less scary.</p>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Learning New Things All the Time (Learning Continuously):</h4>
    
    <p>The world of building keeps changing, with new tools and materials. Builders need to learn about these new things. Programmers are like that too! They always try to learn new tricks so they can keep building amazing programs.</p>
     
    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Practice Makes Perfect (Practicing Regularly):</h4>
    
    <p>The more you build with Legos, the better you get at it. Programmers practice coding every day, even if it's just for a little while. This helps them get better and better at building programs.</p>
     
    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Keeping Track of Your Blocks (Version control):</h4>
    
    <p>Imagine you build a cool Lego creation, but then you accidentally knock it over! With a special box, you could rewind time and go back to how it was before. Programmers use something like this with code, called version control. It lets them track changes and go back to an earlier version if they mess something up.</p>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Taking Breaks for Snacks (Taking Breaks):</h4>
    
    <p>Building can be tiring! Sometimes you need a break to come back with fresh eyes. Programmers do this too! Staring at code for too long can make it hard to see mistakes. Taking breaks helps them come back with a new perspective.</p>

    <h4 class="margin-y-50 text-center">Asking for Help from Friends (Asking for Help):</h4>
    
    <p>Even the best builders sometimes need help from a friend. Programmers are the same! If they get stuck on something, they don't hesitate to ask other programmers or look for answers online. There's no shame in asking for help!</p>

    <p class="margin-top-20">By following these habits, programmers can build amazing and creative things with code, just like you can build incredible things with Legos!</p>
