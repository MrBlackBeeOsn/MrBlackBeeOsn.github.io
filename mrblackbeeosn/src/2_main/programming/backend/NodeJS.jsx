    {/* This is the content of Programming Term. */}

    <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's used for building scalable network applications, web servers, and command-line tools.</p>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Key Features</p>
    
      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>: <strong>Node.js</strong> operates on a single-threaded, non-blocking I/O model. This means it can handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently without creating a new thread for each one. This architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps and streaming services.</li>

        <li><strong>JavaScript Everywhere</strong>: With <strong>Node.js</strong>, developers can use JavaScript for both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development. This allows for code sharing and simplifies the development process for full-stack developers.</li>

        <li><strong>NPM</strong> (<strong>Node Package Manager</strong>): <strong>Node.js</strong> comes with NPM, a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules. This allows developers to easily install and manage dependencies for their projects, accelerating development.</li>

        <li><strong>High Performance</strong>: <strong>Node.js</strong> is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used in Google Chrome. This makes it incredibly fast at executing JavaScript code.</li>

        <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The non-blocking I/O model allows <strong>Node.js</strong> to handle a high volume of requests with minimal overhead, making it highly scalable for building large-scale applications.</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">Common Use Cases</p>
    
      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Web Servers</strong>: <strong>Node.js</strong> is frequently used to build the back-end of web applications, as it can handle multiple simultaneous requests efficiently.</li>

        <li><strong>Real-time Applications</strong>: Its event-driven nature makes it a perfect fit for real-time applications like live chat, online gaming, and collaboration tools.</li>

        <li><strong>API Development</strong>: It's a popular choice for building RESTful APIs that serve data to front-end applications.</li>

        <li><strong>Command-Line Tools</strong>: Developers use <strong>Node.js</strong> to create command-line tools for automating tasks and managing projects.</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">In short, <strong>Node.js</strong> is a powerful tool that has revolutionized server-side development by bringing JavaScript to the back end. Its efficiency and flexibility have made it a cornerstone of modern web development.</p>

    <h3 className="margin-bottom-50 text-center">ðŸŒ¾ Think simply!</h3>

    <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is like a magic box that lets your computer's brain use the same language it uses to make websites pretty, to also make websites smart.</p>
    
      <ul className="list-square">

        <li><strong>Before</strong>: Computers used one language for the pretty parts you see, and a different language for the smart parts that work behind the scenes.</li>

        <li><strong>Now</strong>: <strong>Node.js</strong> lets them use the same language (JavaScript) for everything!</li>

      </ul>

    <p className="margin-top-20">So, with this magic box, a programmer can build a whole website using just one language, which makes building things a lot faster and easier.</p>
