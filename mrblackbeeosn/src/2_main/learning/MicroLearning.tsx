      <h1 className="margin-y-50 text-center">What is component learning?</h1>

      {/* This is the content of Programming Term. */}
      
      <p><strong>Micro-learning</strong> is an approach to education and training that focuses on delivering content in <strong>small</strong>, <strong>highly focused bursts of information</strong>, typically lasting from a few seconds up to a maximum of 10‚Äì15 minutes. Its design is centered on addressing specific learning objectives and fitting into the busy schedules of modern learners.</p>

      <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Core Characteristics</h4>

        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>Duration</strong>: The content is brief and concise, often delivered in 1 to 5-minute segments. The short duration is the defining feature, aligning with the brain's capacity for focused attention.</li>

          <li><strong>Focus</strong>: Each <strong>micro-learning</strong> unit addresses <strong>only one</strong> distinct skill, concept, or learning objective. This narrow scope ensures clarity and prevents cognitive overload.</li>

          <li><strong>Modularity</strong>: The small units are self-contained and stand alone. They can be consumed independently, but they can also be combined and sequenced into longer, comprehensive learning paths.</li>

          <li><strong>Format Diversity</strong>: Content is delivered across various media, including short videos (the most common format), infographics, quizzes, interactive scenarios, brief texts, and flashcards.</li>

          <li><strong>Just-in-Time</strong> (<strong>JIT</strong>) <strong>Learning</strong>: <strong>Micro-learning</strong> is ideally suited for JIT application, meaning the information is accessed and consumed exactly at the moment it is needed (e.g., watching a 3-minute video on how to use a specific software feature just before attempting the task).</li>

        </ul>
      
      <p className="margin-top-20">Advantages and Applications</p>
      
      <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Increased Retention:</h4>
      
      <p>By presenting information in smaller chunks followed by short periods of reflection or application, <strong>micro-learning</strong> aligns with principles of cognitive science, often leading to better information retention and recall than lengthy training sessions.</p>

      <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Flexibility and Accessibility:</h4>
      
      <p>Learners can access content on mobile devices during short breaks, commutes, or in between tasks. This flexibility improves completion rates and allows learning to be seamlessly integrated into the workflow.</p>

      <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Efficiency:</h4>
      
      <p>It saves both the learner's and the organization's time by eliminating unnecessary padding often found in longer modules.</p>

      <h4 className="margin-y-50 text-center">Workplace Training:</h4>
      
      <p>It is widely used in corporate environments for things like:</p>

        <ul className="list-square">

          <li>Onboarding and compliance refreshers.</li>

          <li>Software skill training and feature updates.</li>

          <li>Sales training on new product specifications.</li>

          <li>Performance support (JIT help).</li>

        </ul>

      <p className="margin-top-20">In summary, <strong>micro-learning</strong> is an intentional instructional design strategy that leverages brevity and modularity to make learning more efficient, accessible, and highly effective for mastering specific competencies.</p>

      <p><strong>Micro-learning</strong> is like eating a giant cake, but in tiny, yummy bites! üç∞</p>

        <ul className="list-square">

          <li><strong>The Cake is all the things you need to learn</strong>. Trying to eat the whole cake at once would make your tummy hurt!</li>

          <li><strong>The Tiny Bites are the micro-lessons</strong>. You learn one small thing at a time, like "What is the number 3?" or "How to tie one shoe knot."</li>

          <li><strong>It's fast</strong>"! Each bite only takes a minute or two, so you can learn something new while you wait for the bus or before you start playing!</li>

        </ul>
